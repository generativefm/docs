## About

Generative.fm is an open source web platform for generative music. The project is primarily developed by [Alex Bainter](https://alexbainter.com).

Generative.fm currently offers two products, [Generative.fm Play](https://play.generative.fm) and [Generative.fm Record](https://record.generative.fm). The player is used by significantly more people and is the focus of development efforts.

## History

Generative.fm was created in 2018 by [Alex Bainter](https://alexbainter.com), who designed and developed it over the next four years based on direction from a small community of users. It has always been open source, but allowing for outside contributions wasn't prioritized until 2022.

Originally, Generative.fm was a single product hosted at https://generative.fm which supported playback and later recording of its music generators. In 2021, Generative.fm Play and Generative.fm Record were released as separate products focused on distinct functionality.

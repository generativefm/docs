## About

Generative.fm is an open source web platform for generative music. The project is primarily developed by [Alex Bainter](https://alexbainter.com).

Generative.fm currently offers two products, [Generative.fm Play](https://play.generative.fm) and [Generative.fm Record](https://record.generative.fm). The player is used by significantly more people and is the focus of development efforts.

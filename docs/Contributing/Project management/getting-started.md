# Getting started with project management

Projects can be found in [the organization-level project directory](https://github.com/orgs/generativefm/projects?type=beta). Suggestions for process improvements or similar can be made be [creating an issue](https://github.com/generativefm/issues/issues/new) or [starting a discussion](https://github.com/generativefm/issues/discussions/new) in the [issues](https://github.com/generativefm/issues) repository.

New contributors are encouraged to work as best they can with the permissions granted to them. For example, leaving a comment like "I think this should be labeled 'design'" when they don't have permission to change issue labels. Contributors can be granted more permissions as necessary.

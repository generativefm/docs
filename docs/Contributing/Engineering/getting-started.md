# Getting started with engineering

Engineering work is tracked with Github issues in a relevant repository or in the top-level [issues](https://github.com/generativefm/issues) repository. All issues can be assumed as engineering tasks unless they're labeled "design." Some issues are grouped into projects which can be found at [the organization-level project directory](https://github.com/orgs/generativefm/projects?type=beta). Issues labeled "[good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&type=issues)" are considered most practical for new contributors to work on.

Each repository should have a file named "README.md" and possibly one named "CONTRIBUTING.md" with instructions for getting started with local development. If not, create an issue in that repository asking for those instructions.

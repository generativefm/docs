# Code of conduct

Contributing to Generative.fm should be a positive experience for anyone participating in good faith. In service of this goal, all contributors implicitly agree to follow these rules while participating in the development of Generative.fm.

1. **Respect others.** This includes their work, time, ideas, opinions, beliefs, backgrounds, boundaries, and identities.
2. **Be friendly.** Ask nicely, say "please" and "thank you," encouarage others, and offer criticism constructively.
3. **Have fun.** Participate only in ways which are fun for you and everyone else.
4. **Stay on topic.** Keep discussions and activities relevant to Generative.fm and its development.
5. **Use moderatable language(s).** Please communicate in English so project facilitators can make sure these rules are upheld.

Anyone who can't participate under these terms is kindly asked not to particpate at all. Anyone who violates this code of conduct is subject to the immediate removal of their accounts and content from spaces controlled by Generative.fm, especially in cases of egregious or repeated offenses. If you experience or witness behavior which may violate these rules, please report it to conduct@generative.fm (currently managed by Alex Bainter). Reports are confidential.

Generative.fm project facilitators reserve the right to determine and execute an appropriate response (or lack thereof) for any conduct within Generative.fm's spaces, and to update this document any time.

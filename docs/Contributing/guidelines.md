## Development

Development work is tracked with Github issues in a relevant repository or in the top-level [issues](https://github.com/generativefm/issues) repository. [Here's a list of all the repositories](../repositories.md). Some issues are grouped into projects which can be found at [the organization-level project directory](https://github.com/orgs/generativefm/projects?type=beta).

Tasks which require work from multiple disciplines should be split up into separate issues for each discipline. For example, adding a new visual component should have at least one ticket to track the design work and at least one more to track the engineering work.

Issues labeled "[good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&type=issues)" are considered most practical for new contributors to work on.

### Design

Design tasks are labeled "[design](https://github.com/search?l=&q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign&type=issues)."

- [Here's a list of design issues labeled "good first issue."](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22design%22&type=issues)
- [Here's a list of all design issues.](https://github.com/search?l=&q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign&type=issues)

### Engineering

Each repository should have a file named "README.md" and possibly one named "CONTRIBUTING.md" with instructions for getting started with local development. If not, create an issue in that repository asking for those instructions.

- [Here's a list of engineering issues labeled "good first issue."](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agenerativefm+org%3Agenerative-music+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+-label%3A%22design%22&type=issues)

### Project management

Projects can be found in [the organization-level project directory](https://github.com/orgs/generativefm/projects?type=beta). Suggestions for process improvements or similar can be made be [creating an issue](https://github.com/generativefm/issues/issues/new) or [starting a discussion](https://github.com/generativefm/issues/discussions/new) in the [issues] repository.

New contributors are encouraged to work as best they can with the permissions granted to them. For example, leaving a comment like "I think this should be labeled 'design'" when they don't have permission to change issue labels. Contributors can be granted more permissions as necessary.

# Purpose

Generative.fm is about helping generative music be as accessible and ubiquitous as recorded music. This project aspires to make listening to generative music as commonplace as recorded music for mainstream audiences.

There's an incredible variety of generative music, but Generative.fm chooses to provide a listening experience similar to that of recorded music.

## Music first

Generative.fm focuses on generative systems which produce music many people might enjoy even without an understanding of how they work. Ideally, a listener could enjoy the music without any awareness of generative music.

This approach is in contrast to that of more conceptual generative works, which often require contextual information to fully appreciate. As with recorded music, the nature of conceptual generative works can make them less accessible than more musically-focused generative works.

## Artist directed

Generative.fm currently focuses on non-interactive, non-configurable generative music. This minimizes the differences between listening to generative music and recorded music by reducing the number of ways to experience a work.
